These steps will assist server admins with adding the MVS Desert types files to the server as standalone files. These are NOT to be added to 
the <Mission_Name>/db/types.xml file but instead loaded as their own files. Follow the instructions to add them to your server.

1) Open the MPMissions directory at the root of the server
2) Copy the "mvs-desert-types-ce" directory to your mission folder (<mpmissions/mission_name>)
3) In the mission folder, locate and open cfgeconomycore.cfg
4) After the closing </default> line, add the following:

    <ce folder name="mvs-desert-types-ce">
        <file name="mvs_desert_types.xml" type="types" />
    </ce>

5) Save cfgeconomycore.cfg
6) Edit types to your liking.
